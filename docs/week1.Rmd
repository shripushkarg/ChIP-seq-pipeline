Week 1: ChIPseq Methods

## Introduction

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is used to study protein-DNA 
interactions and epigenetic modifications at a genome-wide scale. In Week 1, our goal is to perform quality 
control (QC), trimming of sequencing reads, and building a genome index for subsequent ChIP-seq data analysis.
This is done intially on the subsamples before using the full files for testing the pipeline's working.

## Quality Control

For quality control, we utilized FastQC, a tool for assessing the quality of high-throughput sequencing data. 
FastQC generates a comprehensive report containing various metrics such as per-base sequence quality, per-sequence 
quality scores, GC content, and sequence length distribution. These metrics allow us to identify potential issues with
the sequencing data, such as adapter contamination, overrepresented sequences, and sequence biases.

We executed FastQC on the raw sequencing reads to evaluate their overall quality and identify any anomalies that may
affect downstream analyses. This step helps in making decisions regarding data preprocessing and filtering.

## Trimming

Trimming of sequencing reads is essential to remove adapter sequences, low-quality bases, and other artifacts that 
may interfere with downstream analysis. We employed Trimmomatic, a tool for read trimming and quality filtering.

The Trimmomatic parameters used for trimming are as follows:
- **ILLUMINACLIP**: Adapter sequences were removed using a predefined adapter file to eliminate any residual adapter 
contamination. We used a mismatch error rate of 2, a palindrome clip threshold of 30, and a simple clip threshold of 10.

- **LEADING**: Trims low-quality bases from the beginning of the reads to improve the overall quality of the data.
The quality threshold was set to 3.

- **TRAILING**: Trims low-quality bases from the end of the reads to enhance the reliability of downstream analyses.
The quality threshold was set to 3.

- **SLIDINGWINDOW**: Applies a sliding window approach to trim bases with average quality scores below a specified 
threshold, thereby improving the overall quality of the reads. We used a window size of 4 and a required quality of 15.

## Building a Genome Index

Alignment of sequencing reads to the reference genome is a crucial step in ChIP-seq data analysis. 
Prior to alignment, a genome index using Bowtie2 was built, a fast and memory-efficient aligner.

The Bowtie2 index allows for rapid and efficient alignment of sequencing reads to the reference genome. 
We used the GRCh38 chr 2 fasta file to construct the index, ensuring compatibility with the reference genome
used in our analysis.

## Conclusion

In Week 1, we performed quality control, trimming of sequencing reads, and built a genome index for subsequent 
ChIP-seq data analysis. These preprocessing steps are essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of 
downstream analyses such as read alignment and peak calling.
